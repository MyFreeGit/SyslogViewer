<h1>Introduction to UI</h1>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 598px; height: 391px;" alt="UI" src="Images/UI.gif"><br>
User can input a "search string" in the combo box where in the toolbar. In this picture, the "search string" is "RU-1".<br>
Below the toolbar is a tab, the tab title is the syslog file name which user opened.<br>
The syslog items are displayed in a table. User can resize the each column to a proper size to read the log.<br>
The table contains those fields (list from left to right)<br>
<ol>
  <li>The first column indicates the bookmark. User can double click on
the log items to toggle the bookmark. Or user can mark bookmarks in
find result (refer to Find.. chapter for the details.) User also can
mark bookmarks in the result fo <a href="#Running_a_python_script">running a python script</a> for the details). In the picture, user bookmarked item 4 and 8.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The second column indicates the line number of each log item in syslog.</li>
  <li>"TimeStamp" indicates the when the syslog is written. To save the

  <li>"PRB" indciates the PRB field.</li>
  <li>"Text" indicates the log text filed. User can copy part of text to clipboard.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
(Note: if the syslog item is wriiten by system or FP, the column "RU" and "PRB" are empty.)<br>
User can copy the selected log items by Ctrl+C to clipboard. And user can select multi-items in the table.<br>

"Find Prev"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User can jump to the previous location of the "search
string". If the begin point of syslog is met, the search is continued
from the end of the syslog.<br>

The functions of button of toolbar are listed from left to right:<br>
<ol>
  <li>User can open a syslog by clicking the first button. Due to
syslog is often big and the application isn't optimized, to avoid the
unexpected crash, the first version of this application only allow user
to only open a syslog. After the user open a syslog, this button is
disabled. User need to run another instance of this application to open another syslog.</li>
  <li>This "save" button isn't functioal, due to this application is readonly. This button is added by eclipse wizard :-)</li>
  <li>User can enter a string to search which log items contain this
string. The combobox can save 10 history "search string". User can
select each of those history "seach string".</li>
  <li>Refer to "Find Prev" in menu chapter for the details.</li>

  <li>Refer to "Prev Bookmark" in menu chapter for the details.</li>
  <li>Refer to "Next Bookmark" in menu chapter for the details.</li>

<h1><a name="Running_a_python_script"></a>Running a python script</h1>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">User can run a python script by click <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Script" src="Images/script_wiz.gif"> button in toolbar. This dialog pops up:<br>
<img style="width: 529px; height: 427px;" alt="Run a python script" src="Images/Run_Script.gif"><br>
In the upper textbox, user can enter a python script or edit the

script"&nbsp; sub-chapter.<br>
User can press "Open Script..." to open a pre-written python script on the disk.<br>
User can press "Run"&nbsp; button to run the python script which
displayed in the textbox. The result of the script is listed in

<br>
<h2 style="margin-left: 40px;">How to write a runnable python script</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">To make application simple, the editing for a complex python script isn't provided.<br>
But user can edit a python in a the PyDev or Jython GUI.<br>
Application using the Jython as python script interpretor, the default
application package has included the Jython, so you needed to install
the Jython to sun the python script in the application. But if you want
to develop a powerful python script which can parse the syslog, you'd
better install a Jython and PyDev and ask me to get jar file that
support the parse the syslog file. (Due to there is no much user yet,
the help doesn't contains the information on how to setup script
development environment.) This charpter only introduce what
functionalities that global variable SYSLOG contains.<br>
